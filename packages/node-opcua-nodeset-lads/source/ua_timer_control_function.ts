 * The TimerControlFunctionType defines a simple

 * It follows the design of other LADS
 * ControlFunctions, utilizing the same state
 * machine and similar variable definitions. As soon
 * as the CurrentValue reaches the TargetValue, the
 * CurrentState of the TimerFunction automatically
 * transitions to Off. This is typically accompanied
 * by some (internal) action/effect, such as
 * stopping the execution of a Function or similar.
 * In the SuspendedState the CurrentValue holds its
 * current value and does not count further until
 * the state switches back to On, either due to a
 * Client command or an internal state change.
